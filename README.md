# Basic Chat App

A very basic chat client which uses socket.io. The app allows user to enter the chat by typing a username. The user can open multiple tabs and be still recognized. The user can send messages using the send button or by pressing enter (new lines can be added using Shift + Enter). A list with active users can be toggled using the button on the top right of the page.

## Run

Run `npm install` to install all dependencies.
Run `node index.js` to start the server and navigate to http://localhost:8080.
